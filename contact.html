        <p>
          Our motivation is deeply rooted in personal experiences and a
          collective commitment to combat drunk driving. Luke's traumatic loss
          of his dog, Coco, to a drunk driving incident at a young age serves as
          a poignant reminder of the devastating consequences. This
          heartbreaking event has fueled our determination to innovate 'The
          Second Chance,' an impactful solution. Beyond individual stories, our
          team's diverse skills coalesce to address this societal issue,
          combining technology, business strategy, and artistic flair. 'The
          Second Chance' is not just a project; it's a passionate response to
          save lives and foster responsible driving habits.
